Build an app with products, check-out and payment process
Your friend has come up with a Pizzadough that has no calories at all. She is a great chef and very good in food technology, but she has no idea how to program a web-store. She asks you to build one. It should display at least one product, handle checkout and payment processes, and have a search function. You can use, of course, third party components such as stripe, Algolia for search, Netflify or AWS for the checkout, Snipcart for the cart.
